# Programming vacancies compare
The program displays the number of vacancies and the average salary for current programming languages.
For analysis, we use data from the sites [hh.ru](https://hh.ru/) and [superjob.ru](https://www.superjob.ru/)


### How to install
In the `.env` file, you need to write your secret key from SuperJob
```text
SUPERJOB_SECRET_KEY = "Your Key"
```
Python3 should already be installed.
Then use `pip` (or` pip3`, there is a conflict with Python2) to install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
